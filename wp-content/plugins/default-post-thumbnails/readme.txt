Display a default thumbnail for posts with no specific thumbnail set using the new functionality (the_post_thumbail() function) in wordpress 2.9

== Description ==

Wordpress 2.9 added support for post thumbnails but you have to set the thumbnail for each post you want to have a thumbnail.
If your site already has hundreds of posts adding a thumbnail image for each post will be a lot of work even if you only want
the same image for each old post.
